## The Hubiquitus actor engine

### Introduction to the actor model

An actor is a form of lightweight computational entity that sequentially process incoming messages received on its inbox.

Actors in Hubiquitus comply with the fundamental properties of an actor as defined by the [Actor Model](|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model):

* each actor has an **inbox**, a kind of FIFO queue into which other actors can post messages to be processed,
* each actor has its proper **behavior** that is triggered sequentially for each message received in its inbox,
* each actor maintains its own **state** that it doesn't share with anyone else ("share nothing" principle); this state can be modified as the actor processes incoming messages.
* each actor can itself post **messages** to other actors; posting message is asynchronous so that it never blocks the process in which the actor is running,
* each actor can create **children** to which it will then be able to post messages as to any other actor.

### Hubiquitus actors

#### Why we choosed NodeJS

Hubiquitus provides a pure implementation of the actor model for the great [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) evented programming platform.

NodeJS is a natural choice as a core to implement the actor model since it provides features that comply with many aspects of the actor model:

* **Single threaded execution**: each NodeJS process run programs using a single execution thread, we are sure to never have to deal with concurrency issues.
* **Asynchronous evented I/O**: NodeJS allows a program to register to specific I/O events - such as "bytes has been written to this socket" - without blocking the execution thread until it occurs. This provides a simple and elegant way to implement actors inboxes.
* **Child processes**: NodeJS natively supports creating forked process that communicates with their parent process using an IPC socket channel, so that creating child actors becomes trivial.
* **First-class functions**: since it relies on the JavaScript programming language, NodeJS allows passing functions as parameters so that passing a behavior as a function to an actor is also trivial.

#### Anatomy of a hubiquitus actor

Most of the Hubiquitus magic lay behind a single JavaScript objet called *hactor* that defines the structure common to every Hubiquitus actors:

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
|value|value|

* a **unique key** that identifies the actor, a simple string formatted as a JID
* a **behavior calllback** that is fired each time the actor receives a message
* a set of **addresses** onto which the actor will accept incoming messages
* an in-memory **state object** that the behavior function can read and write to
* a list of **references to children** that could have been created by the actor
* a list of **references to trackers**, special actors that maintain the address book of all the actors

#### Coding your first actor

All you have to do to create an actor is to instanciate this object with the following parameters:

* a unique actor **ID**
* a list of **one or more URLs** - the actor's inbound endpoints - that the actor will listen to for incoming messages,
* a **custom JavaScript callback** - the actor's behavior - that will be fired each time a message is received.

Once instanciated, you just have to start your actor and begin sending it messages, *et voil√†* !

	// 	Instanciate your actor
	var MyActor = require('hubiquitus').hactor(
		{ id: "myactor@localhost", in:["tcp://*.8888"]},
		function(err, message){
			// code your behavior below
		});

	// Starting your actor
	MyActor.start();

#### Inbound adapters

When you start your actor, the "hactor" class will first select, instanciate and start the inbound adapters that match the endpoint URLs you have specified.

Inbound adapters are special objects that are responsible for:

* listening to the port you have specified using the transport protocol you have specified
* registering the actor's behavior (remember, the custom callback you specified) to further I/O events (incoming messages)
